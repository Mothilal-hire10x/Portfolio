# Portfolio

A modern, animated personal portfolio website built to showcase a resume, skills, and projects. This single-page site uses smooth transitions, a professional UI, and subtle neon effects with elegant two- to three-color gradients to create a sleek, interactive experience.

**Contents**
- **Live Demo:** Add your deployed site URL here (e.g., GitHub Pages or Netlify)
- **Author:** Your name or handle
- **License:** Add a license (MIT recommended)

## Features

- Single-page responsive layout
- Smooth animated transitions and subtle neon-inspired styling
- Sections for About, Skills, Projects, Resume, and Contact
- Easy to customize and extend

## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3 (+ custom animations)
- (Optional) JavaScript for interactivity

## Getting Started

These instructions will get the project running locally for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- Git (optional, for cloning)

### Local Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd Portfolio
```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser, or use a simple HTTP server for local testing:

```bash
# Python 3.x
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

## Deployment

You can host this site on GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any static host. If using a custom domain, add a `CNAME` file with your domain (already present in this repo).

## Customization

- Update content directly in `index.html`.
- Replace colors, gradients, and animations in the main stylesheet (if present).
- Add projects to the Projects section and link to live demos or repositories.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue or submit a pull request with proposed changes.

## License

Add your preferred license text here (for example, MIT). If you want, I can add a `LICENSE` file.

## Contact

Add an email address or link to your preferred contact method (Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.).

If you'd like, I can also:

- Add a `LICENSE` file (MIT)
- Add a basic `package.json` and a tiny build script (if you plan to use a build tool)
- Add a screenshot and demo link to the README

Tell me which of the above you'd like me to add and I will proceed.
